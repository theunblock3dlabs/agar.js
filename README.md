Agar.js is a pure front-end implementation of the popular massively multiplayer
game Agar.io. The entire project was created using vanilla JavaScript and
HTML5 canvas.

## Instructions

Play the game by following the live link above.

Directions:
- [ ] Big cells eat the little ones
- [ ] Navigate the board by moving your cursor towards your desired destination

## Technologies Used

- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] HTML5 Canvas

## Features

### Panning Camera

The `Background` class first generates a grid on a fresh canvas using two
separate loops to draw the longitude and latitude lines:


    // longitude
    for (let i = 0; i <= bw; i += squareSize) {
      ctx.moveTo(0.5 + i + p, p);
      ctx.lineTo(0.5 + i + p, bh + p);
    }

    // latitude
    for (let i = 0; i <= bh; i += squareSize) {
      ctx.moveTo(p, 0.5 + i + p);
      ctx.lineTo(bw + p, 0.5 + i + p);
    }

It then crops the grid image when Board.draw
is invoked in the `Game` class:

    ctx.drawImage(
      this.image,
      sx,
      sy,
      sWidth,
      sHeight,
      dx,
      dy,
      dWidth,
      dHeight
    );

Where `sx` and `sy` are the top-left coordinates of the viewport (camera),
`sWidth` and `sHeight` are the source images dimensions,
`dx` and `dy` are the coordinates where the the top-left corner of the
image is drawn, and `dWidth`/`dHeight` represent the scaling of the image.

An object is then set to follow in the `Camera` class. By keeping track of
the `followed` object's (x, y) coordinates, it's able to update the
coordinates (`xView, yView` a.k.a. `sx, sy` above) of where it's
top-left corner should be. The player is kept centered in the `Camera` by
setting `xView` and `yView` equal to the `Player`'s `x` and `y` positions
less half the window's current height:

    if ((this.followed.x - windowWidth / 2) > 0 &&
          (this.followed.x) < this.worldW) {
        this.xView = this.followed.x - windowWidth / 2;
    }

    if ((this.followed.y - windowHeight / 2) > 0 &&
          (this.followed.y) < this.worldH) {
      this.yView = this.followed.y - windowHeight / 2;
    }

## Cursor Movement

To implement player cell movement, the `Cell` generated by the `HumanPlayer`
class is centered on the drawn canvas and the position of the player's
cursor relative to the cells position is used to calculate the movement
vector the cell will folow. In order to ensure the cell never moves to fast,
I capped the relative move speed at 3 and -3. This was all accomplished with
the following code:

    this.mouseX = controls.x;
    this.mouseY = controls.y;

    this.relativeX = this.x - this.xView;
    this.relativeY = this.y - this.yView;

    this.relativeXDirection = this.mouseX - this.relativeX;
    this.relativeYDirection = this.mouseY - this.relativeY;

    // limits movement to a max of 3 and min of -3
    this.xMovement =
      Math.min(Math.max(this.relativeXDirection * step, -3), 3);
    this.yMovement =
      Math.min(Math.max(this.relativeYDirection * step, -3), 3);

    this.x += this.xMovement;
    this.y += this.yMovement;


## The Future

 1. Fix win/lose screens
 2. Implement a better AI
 3. Add splitting
 4. Add custom skins
 5. Add viruses
